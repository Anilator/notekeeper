# Notekeeper
**Installation**: `sudo npm i -g notekeeper`

----


This is a simple Node.js utility for making notes.

1. write `notekeeper` is your command line (I prefer an alias "note")
2. the Notefile will be automatically opened is your lovely Text Editor
3. write something, press **save** and it's done: your new note is appended to base.txt
