# Notekeeper
**Installation**: `sudo npm i -g notekeeper`

----


This is a simple Node.js utility for making notes.

1. type `notekeeper` in your command line (I prefer just "note" as alias)
2. the Notefile will be automatically opened in your preferred Text Editor
3. write something, press **save** and it's done: your new note is appended to database txt-file
